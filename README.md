# XRandR Auto

A replacement for [XRandR](https://www.x.org/wiki/Projects/XRandR/) by the X.Org
Foundation. This project builds upon XRandR with improvements to code quality,
and testing. The project also automates the management of monitor hot-plugging;
when running the daemon for xrandr-auto. This automation allows configuration of
monitors that have been plugged in quickly and easily; as well as remembering
previous configurations.
